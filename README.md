# EctoFixtures #

Fixtures for Ecto

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/DockYard/ecto_fixtures.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/dockyard/ecto_fixtures)

## Usage ##

Fixture files should be stored in `test/fixtures/`. The format of a
fixture file is as:

```elixir
# test/fixtures/accounts.exs

accounts model: Account, repo: Repo do
  test do
    email "test@example.com"
    name "Brian Cardarella"
    password_hash :crypto.sha("password")
  end
end
```

In your test file you can access the fixture sets with the
by tagging each test with the fixtures you want to load then 
pattern matching on the `data` field for the `context` argument.

```elixir
defmodule MyTestCase do
  use ExUnit.Case
  use EctoFixtures

  @tag fixtures: :accounts
  test "data test", %{data: data}  do
    assert data.accounts.test.email == "test@example.com"
  end
end
```

This data is also inserted into the database, the resulting data set
returned from `fixtures/1` is actually an `Ecto.Model`.


```elixir
defmodule MyTestCase do
  use ExUnit.Case
  use EctoFixtures

  test "database data is inserted and equal to data set", %{data: data} do
    assert data.accounts.test == Repo.get(Account, accounts.test.id)
  end
end
```

## Avoiding Inserts

If you'd like the model structs without actually inserting into the
database pass `insert: false` to `fixtures/2`.

```elixir
defmodule MyTestCase do
  use ExUnit.Case
  import EctoFixtures, only: [fixtures: 2]

  test "database data is inserted and equal to data set" do
    fixtures(:accounts, insert: false)

    assert length(Repo.all(Account)) == 0
  end
end
```

## Optional Overrides

You can override the fixture data on a per-usage basis by passing a map
as the 2nd argument. The maps keys must correspond with the structure of
the fixture names and row names column data you wish to override.

**Note: you cannot add rows with the override. It is intended only to
mutate the fixture column data**

```elixir
defmodule MyTestCase do
  use ExUnit.Case
  import EctoFixtures, only: [fixtures: 2]

  test "data test" do
    %{accounts: accounts} = fixtures(:accounts, %{
      accounts: %{
        test: %{
          email: "other@example.com"
        }
      }
    })

    assert accounts.test.email != "test@example.com"
    assert accounts.test.email == "other@example.com"
  end
end
```

## Associations

Associations can be made between data sets, reference the data set's
name and label:

### Belongs To

```elixir
accounts model: Account, repo: Repo do
  brian do
    name "Brian"
  end
end

events model: Event, repo: Repo do
  one do
    name "First Event"
    account accounts.brian
  end
end
```

### Has One

```elixir
accounts model: Account, repo: Repo do
  brian do
    name "Brian"
    pet pets.boomer
  end
end

pets model: Pet, repo: Repo do
  boomer do
    name "Boomer"
  end
end
```

### Has Many

```elixir
accounts model: Account, repo: Repo do
  brian do
    name "Brian"
    events [events.one, events.two]
  end
end

events model: Event, repo: Repo do
  one do
    name "First Event"
  end
  two do
    name "Second Event"
  end
end
```

### Between other fixtures files

Associations can also be made between fixture files:

```elixir
# test/fixtures/accounts.exs
accounts model: Account, repo: Repo do
  brian do
    name "Brian"
    pet fixtures(:pets).pets.boomer
  end
end

# test/fixtures/pets.exs
pets model: Pet, repo: Repo do
  boomer do
    name "Boomer"
  end
end
```

### Handling Foreign Key Constraints

ecto_fixtures will determine the assocation type being made and ensure
that child records are always inserted *after* the parent record to
avoid any foreign key constraint issues, regardless of the order in
which the fixtures are loaded. 

## Inheriting Data

If you'd like to have default values inherited into other rows you can
do that with the `inherit` option on the row defintion:

```elixir
accounts model: Account, repo: Repo do
  default do
    is_admin false
  end

  brian inherits: default do
    name "Brian"
  end
end

other_accounts: Account, repo: Repo do
  stephanie inherits: accounts.default do
    name "Stephanie"
    is_admin true
  end
end
```

When inheriting from rows in the same group you can simply refer to the
row name. When referring to rows in other groups you have to refer to
the group name and table name.

You can inherit data from other fixture files as well:

```elixir
# test/fixtures/accounts.exs
accounts model: Account, repo: Repo do
  default do
    is_admin false
  end

  brian inherits: default do
    name "Brian"
  end
end

# test/fixtures/other_accounts.exs
other_accounts: Account, repo: Repo do
  stephanie inherits: fixtures(:accounts).accounts.default do
    name "Stephanie"
    is_admin true
  end
end
```

Inherited values can be overriden by defining values on the same column.

### Virtual Rows

Sometimes you may not want the row you inherit from to be inserted into
the database. In this case you must set the `virtual: true` flag for
that row:

```elixir
accounts model: Account, repo: repo do
  default virtual: true do
    is_admin false
  end
end
```
